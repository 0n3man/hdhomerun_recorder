Description:
    A python program to record TV programs using hdhomerun tuner device.
    This should run on any system capable of running python. In other
    words, no other dependencies other than python and apscheduler
    python module.

    The hdhomerun tuner doesn't need much processing power for recording
    a program. So this is mainly intended for embedded systems. I use it
    on my WDTV Live media player.

INSTALL:
    1. Install python if you don't have it already
    2. Install apscheduler from here. The old version of apscheduler has
        some issues, so be sure to install the latest V2 version.

    3. Copy three files from this project to some place on your system
       1. recorder.py: The main python program
       2. config-file: My config file, replace at least the channelmap section
                       with your local channels.
       3. schedule-file: This is an example schedule file. Modify entries
                         with programs you like to record.
    4. Copy hdhomerun_config binary to the directory that contains above
       files
    5. Run ./recorder.py and watch ./logfile for log output.

WDTV Live player:
    I use wdlxtv firmware (third party firmware, http://wiki.wdlxtv.com)
    on my WDTV Live media player.  Since it does not come with python, I use
    optware bin and installed python using ipkg. Thanks to b-rad!
